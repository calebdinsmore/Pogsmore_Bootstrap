Hello, Dr. Geisler!

Wasn't sure how you wanted this to be submitted, but we figured that a zip file was the best method. Just click on the html file and it'll load up our project.

You'll notice that we even have a working collapse button (the "open" icon in the middle of the page). That took a bit of effort to incorporate, haha.

Hope you like our submission!
